BAX452 - Machine Learning

This repository contains all my assignments from the Machine Learning Course I took as a part of my MS in Business Analytics at UC Davis. I studied under Jorn Boehnke, a truly masterful teacher and professor.


During this course I learnt how to construct algorithms for learning from data and analyze the process for deriving business intelligence. Coverage of supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, etc.

After taking this course, I learnt how to explore and analyze large highdimensional datasets, became adept at building powerful systems for prediction, and gain the understanding necessary for interpreting the structure in such models. 

The topics included:

Regression
Treatment Effect
Bootstrap
Model Selection
Classification
Clustering
Factors
Trees
Neural Networks
Natural Language Processing
Reinforcement Learning
Spatiotemporal Analysis

I learnt both basic underlying concepts and practical computational skills, including
techniques for analysis of distributed data. Strong emphasis is placed on the analysis of
actual datasets, and on the development of application specific methodology.
