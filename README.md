BAX452 - Machine Learning

I did this Machine Learning Course as a part of my MS in Business Analytics at UC Davis. I studied under Jorn Boehnke, a truly masterful teacher and professor.


Construct algorithms for learning from data and analyze the process for deriving business intelligence. Coverage of supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, etc.
Restricted to students enrolled in MSBA program at UC Davis

After taking this course, you will know how to explore and analyze large highdimensional datasets, become adept at building powerful systems for prediction, and
gain the understanding necessary for interpreting the structure in such models. The
topics include:
Introduction
Regression
Treatment Effect
Bootstrap
Model Selection
Classification
Clustering
Factors
Trees
Neural Networks
Natural Language Processing
Reinforcement Learning
Spatiotemporal Analysis*
We learn both basic underlying concepts and practical computational skills, including
techniques for analysis of distributed data. Strong emphasis is placed on the analysis of
actual datasets, and on the development of application specific methodology.
